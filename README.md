# Linking-CVE-to-Mitre-Techniques
Replicated code and new models to try to improve accuracy linking CVE to Mitre Techniques

#### **NOTE : Make sure to download the required dataset from Model Dataset (and vector embeddings if required) to execute the code.

## Contents :

I will briefly explain the contents of each folder :

1. Classifier Chain : Contains the codes used to test Classifier Chain model (on the evaluation set) as well as comparison of the performance of feature extractions.

2. Cross-Validate Comparisons : Final cross validation comparisons of the Classifier Chain model as well as the Labelpowerset(neural) model (by Mendsaikhan et. al.). Both main and augmented datasets were tested.

3. Data Augmentation : The code used for data augmentation, more specifically, the EasyDataAugmentor from the textattack module. The augmented data can also be found in the "Model Dataset/Augmented Dataset" folder. 

4. Extra Contributions : This consists of 2 contributions :
   - A new dataset encapsulating more techniques which can, after reassessment, can be added to the main dataset to improve the model quality and encapsulate more CVE to Mitre Techniques for the models to learn from.
   - An attempt of balancing the dataset using MLSMOTE. This can possibly work to improve the dataset balance. The method failed but can possibly be fixed by finding the right n_sample and neigh values.

5. Grigorescu : The code for the Multilabel SciBERT model by Grigorescu et. al.

6. Mendsaikhan : The replicated code for the Labelpowerset(neural) model by Mendsaikhan et. al. on both the original and fixed dataset. 

7. Model Dataset : All the datasets required for all the models used. This also includes the Augmented Dataset and the USE vector embeddings of the Fixed as well as Augmented datasets.

8. New Model Testing : This consists of the XGBoost and CatBoost models tested on the evaluation set. Classifier Chain is also part of the new models tested but since it showed the best results, the code was put in a seperate folder named "Classifier Chain".
