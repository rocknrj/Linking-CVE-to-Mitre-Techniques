This folder contains the code of the Multi-Label SciBERT model by Grigorescu et al.. The augmentation method was extracted from here to test on our model.

### Note : The dataset for this code is only partial and the performance therefore could not be accurately measured. However the improvement with data augmentation could still be seen.
