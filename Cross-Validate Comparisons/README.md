This section contains the code for Labelpowerset(neural), the best model from the literature, and the Classifier Chain, the best new model tested, undergoing various cross validation methods to measure their performance and to then compare with each other.
Both the fixed as well as the augmented dataset were wit each cross validation method.

## 1. (Augmented) Classifier Chain CV Comparison
Contains the code for the Classifier Chain model undergoing various cross validation methods on both the fixed as well as the augmented dataset.

## 2. (Augmented) Mendsaikhan Fixed Dataset CV Comparison
Contains the code for the Labelpowerset(neural) model undergoing various cross validation methods on both the fixed as well as the augmented dataset.
