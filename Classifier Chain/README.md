## 1. Classifier Chain Feature Extraction Comparison
This code compares different feature extractors and tests the performance of Classifier Chain on the evaluation set of 200 to compare their performance. The feature extractors compared were :
  - **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**
  - **TF-IDF**
  - **Count Vectorizer**

## 2. Classifier Chain Fine Tuning (StratifiedKFold)
This code performs fine tuning on the Classifier Chain and Logistic Regression parameters while testing the performance with the Custom StratifieldKFold cross validation method.

## 3. Classifier Chain - Evaluation Set (Best Augment)
This code shows the best performance score achieved on the evaluation set using the Classifier Chain model *using the augmented datset*. This, along with the non augmented dataset, was the first step of comparison done after which a more thorough comparison was done with the Labelpowerset(neural) model. It is due to the scores achieved here in comparison with the Labelpowerset(neural) model performance on the same evaluation set that the decision for a more thorough comparison with this model was done.

## 4. Classifier Chain - Evaluation Set (Best Augment)
This code shows the best performance score achieved on the evaluation set using the Classifier Chain model *using the fixed datset*. This, along with the augmented dataset, was the first step of comparison done after which a more thorough comparison was done with the Labelpowerset(neural) model. It is due to the scores achieved here in comparison with the Labelpowerset(neural) model performance on the same evaluation set that the decision for a more thorough comparison with this model was done.

## 5. Classifier Chain - Evaluation Set (With Time)
This code shows the training and test time taken for this model.

## 6. Classifier Chain Iterative(best) - Evaluation Set
This code shows the performance of the Classifier Chain model using iterative stratification on the **augmented dataset**.

## 7. Classifier Chain KFold (FAILED)
This code shows the **FAILED** (One fold failed due to class imbalance and hence no accuracy could be measured on that fold) attempt of using the standard KFold cross validation on the Classifier Chain model.
