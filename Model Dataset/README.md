# This file contains the datasets used to train and test the various models.

## Contents

## 1. Augmented Dataset
This folder contains the augmented version (using EasyDataAugmentor from the textattack module) of the **fixed** Labelpowerset(neural) dataset which was the main dataset used.
## 2. Fixed Dataset
This folder contains the updated version of the original Labelpowerset(neural) model. This dataset was updated to match the latest version of the Mitre Framework as the technique ID's changed/became deprecated. The different versions are simply a slight change in format as different models were tried. However the data is the same.
## 3. Grigorescu
This folder contains the partial (what could be retrieved) dataset of the Multi-Label SciBERT Model which was tested.
## 4. Mendsaikhan Original
This folder contains the original dataset used for the Labelpowerset(neural) model implemented by Mendsaikhan et. al.
## 5. USE Vector Embeddings
This folder contains the vector embeddings of the **fixed** Labelpowerset(neural) using Universal Sentence Encoder. (the code for this is available in the Mendsaikhan folder however, the embeddings are saved here if one wishes for a faster execution as creating the embeddings from the main code can be skipped.)
