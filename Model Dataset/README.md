# This file contains the datasets used to train and test the various models.

## Contents

- **Augmented Dataset** contains the augmented version (using EasyDataAugmentor from the textattack module) of the **fixed** Labelpowerset(neural) dataset which was the main dataset used.
- **Fixed Dataset** contains the updated version of the original Labelpowerset(neural) model. This dataset was updated to match the latest version of the Mitre Framework as the technique ID's changed/became deprecated.
- **Grigorescu** contains the partial (what could be retrieved) dataset of the Multi-Label SciBERT Model which was tested.
- **Mendsaikhan Original** contains the original dataset used for the Labelpowerset(neural) model implemented by Mendsaikhan et. al.
- **USE Vector Embeddings** contains the vector embeddings of the **fixed** Labelpowerset(neural) using Universal Sentence Encoder. (the code for this is available in the Mendsaikhan folder however, the embeddings are saved here if one wishes for a faster execution as creating the embeddings from the main code can be skipped.)
