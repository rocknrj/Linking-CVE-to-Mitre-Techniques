## 1. Dataset Contribution
An additional 111 new links which after further assessment can be possibly added to the current dataset to help improve the model an encapsulate more techniques.

## 2. MLSMOTE
An additional attempt was made to further balance the dataset using MLSMOTE. Howeve, as suggested in the notes in the file, setting the right parameter values could possibly further aid in balancing the dataset and therefore improving the model.
