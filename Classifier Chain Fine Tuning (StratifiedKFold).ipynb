    "multilabel classification task linking cve_id and description to multiple technique IDs, both solvers can be applicable, but the choice might depend on the nature of your data:\n",
    "\n",
    " -   If you believe that the relationships between cve_id, description, and technique IDs are complex and nonlinear, and you want the model to capture those complexities, then newton-cg might be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    " -   If you think that the relationships are more linear or that the problem can be effectively approximated with a linear model, then liblinear can be a suitable and efficient choice.\n",

    " I believe the relationship between the CVE_ID description and techniques are complex and non linear, however both these solvers can be further tested with an improved dataset to see how it fares.\n",
